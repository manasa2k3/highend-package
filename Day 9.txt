Counting_Sort:
Counting Sort is a non-comparison-based sorting algorithm that works well when there is limited range of input values

Counting Sort Pgogram:

def counting_sort(arr):
    max_val = max(arr)
    count_array = [0] * (max_val + 1)
    for num in arr:
        count_array[num] += 1
    sorted_array = []
    for i in range(len(count_array)):
        while count_array[i] > 0:
            sorted_array.append(i)
            count_array[i] -= 1
    
    return sorted_array
arr = [1,3,2,1,3,0,5,1]
sorted_arr = counting_sort(arr)
print(sorted_arr)

Linear Search:
A linear search is also known as a sequential search that simply scans each element at a time. 
Suppose we want to search an element in an array or list; we simply calculate its length and do not jump at any item.

Linear search Program:

def linear_search(arr, target):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] == target:
            return i 
    return -1 
arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]
target = 5
result = linear_search(arr, target)
if result != -1:
    print(f"Target {target} found at index {result}.")
else:
    print(f"Target {target} not found in the array.")
